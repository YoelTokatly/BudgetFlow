# BudgetFlow
A cloud-based solution that streamlines the budget consolidation process for global organizations
BudgetFlow allows subsidiary controllers to upload budget data through a user-friendly web interface that performs automatic validation checks and generates real-time P&L summaries. The system eliminates data inconsistencies by enforcing standardized templates and stores validated financial information securely in a cloud database for seamless centralized analysis.
Built using Linux, Bash, Python, and AWS or AZURE services, BudgetFlow bridges the gap between traditional Microsoft-based financial workflows and modern cloud infrastructure to create a more efficient financial data pipeline
